description: "The fastest and cheapest way to bridge & transact across chains"
---

Tunnel is a gas minimized, lightning fast cross-chain payments infrastructure designed for a multichain future. Our goal is cheaper, faster, and more flexible payments that let you transact on more chains. Under the hood, Tunnel's cross-chain tech is powered by cross-chain relaying. This model results in low-cost, low-latency (1-10 seconds) cross-chain transactions. Learn more about the [Technical Details of Tunnel](/how-it-works/understanding-tunnel). Tunnel enables both Instant Bridging and Cross-chain Execution on supported chains.
