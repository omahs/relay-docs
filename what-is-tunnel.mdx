title: What is Tunnel?
description: "Tunnel is the fastest and cheapest way to bridge & transact across chains"
---

Tunnel is a gas-minimized, lightning fast cross-chain payments system. The goal of tunnel is cheaper, faster, and more flexible payments that let you transact on more chains. Under the hood, Tunnel's cross-chain tech is powered by relaying.

TUNNEL HERO IMAGE

When a user wants to "bridge" from Chain A to Chain B using Tunnel, she makes a payment to a relayer on chain A in exchange for a payment from the relayer on chain B. For more complex execution on chain B, the user must simply tell the relayer what he or she wants delivered (or executed) on chain B. This model results in low-cost, low-latency (1-10 seconds) cross-chain transactions. Learn more about the [Technical Details of Tunnel](/how-it-works/understanding-tunnel). Today, Tunnel enables both Instant Bridging and Cross-chain Execution on supported chains.
