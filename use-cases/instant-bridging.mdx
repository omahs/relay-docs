Tunnel enables instant bridging (deposits & withdrawals) on supported chains. Learn more about how it works, how to integrate Tunnel, and how to get your chain supported below.

## How it Works

Tunnel's instant bridging is powered by cross-chain relaying. This model results in low-cost, low-latency (1-10 seconds) cross-chain transactions. Today, users of Tunnel work with a third-party provider for cross-chain relaying, such as Reservoir. Third parties escrow funds and take on reputational risk in the case of cross-chain disputes. Learn more about the [Technical Details of Tunnel](/what-is-tunnel).

## Integrating Instant Bridging

Tunnel is directly integrated into the Reservoir API & SDK. To get started make sure that you install and configure the [Reservoir SDK](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/reservoir-sdk-jstsnode) or [ReservoirKit](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/reservoirkit) (which exposes a client that you can tap into using the [useReservoirClient](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/reservoirkit-hooks#usereservoirclient) hook). In this example we'll be using the Reservoir SDK. Ensure that everything is configured properly before moving on to implementing the call action.

```typescript Instant Bridge

import { getClient, Execute } from "@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk";
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'

...

wallet = createWalletClient({
  account: address,
  transport: http()
})

//A simple bridge requires no data, so 0x (null data) is provided
//In this example we're bridging from zora to base

getClient().actions.call({
  chainId: 7777777, //This is not required as the call action will use the active configured chain
  toChainId: 8453,
  txs: [{
    to: "0x03508bB71268BBA25ECaCC8F620e01866650532c",
   	value: "1000000",
    data: "0x"
  }],
  wallet: wallet,
  onProgress: (steps) => {
    console.log(steps)
  },
})
```

## Adding Tunnel to Your Chain

Tunnel can easily be added to any EVM-chain, such as OP stack rollups, Arbitrum Orbit chains, or more. Please feel free to [Reach Out] to discuss getting you chain supported today!
