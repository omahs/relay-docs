Relay enables instant bridging (deposits & withdrawals) on supported chains. Learn more about how it works, how to integrate Relay, and how to get your chain supported below.

## How it Works

Relay's instant bridging is powered by cross-chain relaying. This model results in low-cost, low-latency (1-10 seconds) cross-chain transactions. Today, users of Relay work with Reservoir for cross-chain relaying. Applications trust Reservoir to perform cross-chain relaying, and refund money in the case of disputes. Learn more about the [Technical Details of Relay](/what-is-relay).

## Integrating Instant Bridging

The Relay SDK facilitates interacting with the underlying Relay API. To get started make sure that you install and configure the [Relay SDK](https://docs.relay.link/references/sdk/getting-started).Ensure that everything is configured properly before moving on to implementing the call action.

```typescript Instant Bridge

import { getClient, Execute } from "@reservoir0x/relay-sdk";
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'

...

wallet = createWalletClient({
  account: address,
  transport: http()
})

//A simple bridge requires no data, so 0x (null data) is provided
//In this example we're bridging from zora to base

getClient().actions.call({
  chainId: 7777777, //This is not required as the call action will use the active configured chain
  toChainId: 8453,
  txs: [{
    to: "0x03508bB71268BBA25ECaCC8F620e01866650532c",
   	value: "1000000",
    data: "0x"
  }],
  wallet: wallet,
  onProgress: (steps) => {
    console.log(steps)
  },
})
```

## Adding Relay to Your Chain

Relay can easily be added to any EVM-chain, such as OP stack rollups, Arbitrum Orbit chains, or more. Please feel free to [Reach Out](mailto:support@relay.link) to discuss getting you chain supported today!
