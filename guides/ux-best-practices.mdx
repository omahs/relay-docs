description: 'How to get the most out of Relay and cross chain execution'
---
Unlike other interoperability products, Relay is designed to be so fast and cheap that transacting cross-chain is indistinguishable from making regular transactions. This makes it possible to build delightful experiences that reduce friction for users.

## Chain Abstraction

Increasingly, users _don't care_ what chain they're interacting on, so long as it's easy and secure. 

When interacting

- Destination = Where they will interact
- Origin = Where they will pay
- Current = Where they are connected now

Arguably, the Destination Chain is the least important of these from the users' perspective. The Origin matters, because they need funds there

## Bridging vs Cross Chain Execution

One key decision is whether you want to encourage users to explicitly "bridge" enough funds to a chain to make multiple actions, or whether they should execute each action cross chain "just in time". Each option has pros and cons: 

- **Bridge** - More efficient, but creates friction because user needs to decide how much to bridge
- **Execute** - Less friction, but also less efficiency

The decision of which is best for your app depends on a few factors

- **Repetition** - If the user needs to take multiple actions, bridging might make sense, but if it's a single core one (e.g. an NFT mint), cross chain execution is the obvious choice
- **Permutations** - If the user needs to transact on multiple chains
- **Aha Moment** - Rather than requiring the user to bridge
